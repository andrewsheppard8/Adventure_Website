I am going on a big trip through Asia and I want to practice creating an API using Flask. And then it completely took on a mind of its own. This is practice creating/managing spatial information. It is very much a work in progress.

Some minor things I always forget:

geojson==3.2.0

git pull origin main --rebase

pip freeze > requirements.txt
